Assorted solutions to programming exercises from https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/

These are not intended to be polished "production" libraries; in fact they are mostly first pass implementations, rough and unoptimized approaches to solving the problems presented. I am going to be selecting interesting challenges that offer an opportunity to learn something new or test existing skills. It will also provide a sort of sandbox to experiment with new/different languages and frameworks, with the ability to try out new code in a small one-off without committing to using it for an entire project.

Each directory represents a single challenge, following the naming convention `./dpc_329e` to represent the challenge number and difficulty level (**e**asy, **i**ntermediate, and **h**ard). Commits are similarly flagged with a leading syntax to associate each with an individual challenge in the format `[329E]`.

Most challenges will be considered 'complete' with a single commit, a baseline working version that provides functionality to handle the challenge input included in the description. More involved or engaging exercises might lead to additional commits and experimentation to extend the functionality further, as time allows room to explore where the prompts may lead.
